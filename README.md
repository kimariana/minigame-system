**Critical Density**  
Senior Game Production Capstone Project – Team of 9 | 2.5D narrative-driven exploration/resource management game with RPG elements

- Developed core gameplay mechanics including hook ability, barrier activation, and resource collection systems.

This repository contains a portion of the work I contributed to the Critical Density project. Included in this repo is a Unity project with all of my files related to the minigame system of the game. The wiki contains [documentation](https://github.com/kimariana/minigame-system/wiki/Minigame-System) regarding this project.
