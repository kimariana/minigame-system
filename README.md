**Critical Density**  
Senior Game Production Capstone Project – Team of 9 | 2.5D narrative-driven exploration/resource management game with RPG elements

- Developed core gameplay mechanics including hook ability, barrier activation, and resource collection systems.
- Integrated inventory and quest systems with resource collection mechanics to support item-based objectives.
- Implemented branching dialogue and narrative sequences using the Ink scripting language.
- Collaborated with designers, artists, and writers to align gameplay features with story pacing and world-building.
- Conducted regular playtesting sessions and iterated on player feedback to refine mechanics and resolve bugs.

This repository contains a portion of the work I contributed to the Critical Density project. Included in this repo is a Unity project with all of my files related to the minigame system of the game. The wiki contains [documentation](https://github.com/kimariana/minigame-system/wiki/Minigame-System) regarding this project.

## Description
This project is a narrative-driven exploration and resource management game centered around a lone scrapper/junker in the star system Ross-128, a centralized dumping ground wedged between all existing worlds. As various worlds tear through Ross 128 space-time, you traverse to these rifts and gather valuable scrap from the dimensional rifts.  By completing quests given by local shopkeepers the narrative can be progressed, as well as the acquisition of upgrades for various systems such as shopkeeping or ship parts.  

## Contributions
- Minigame system to collect items when interacting with a scrap node/wormhole
  - Hook ability of the player ship (to collect scrap)
  - Barrier ability of the player ship (to protect against enemies and items)

- Integration of other systems (inventory and quest) to work with resource collection mechanics
- Implementation of dialogue and narrative sequences using Ink
